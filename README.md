## üîêAbout The Project

<p>
Password Manager is a decentralized password management application built with Flutter and Supabase, designed to give users full control over their own data. Unlike traditional password managers that store data on centralized servers owned by developers, this app follows a user-owned, privacy-first architecture:</p>

-   ‚úÖ Users create their own Supabase project and manually input their project's API URL and Key into the app.

-   ‚úÖ These credentials are stored locally on the user‚Äôs device and are never uploaded or saved to any external server.

-   ‚úÖ The app requires users to set up a personal passcode, which is securely stored on the device using flutter_secure_storage. This passcode is also never stored in Supabase.

-   ‚úÖ All data stored in Supabase is AES-encrypted using the user‚Äôs passcode as the encryption key, ensuring that only the user can decrypt and access their information.

<p>This approach guarantees maximum privacy, strong security, and full ownership of data, making it an ideal solution for users who care deeply about their digital security and independence.</p>
